# housepriceprediction
Description: 
Develop a regression model to predict house prices based on features like size, location, number 
of rooms, and year built. This project is ideal for understanding regression algorithms. 
Steps: 
1. Data Collection: Use datasets like the Kaggle Housing Price Dataset. 
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, scale numerical features, and encode 
categorical data (e.g., location). 
3. Model Building: Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, 
and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost or LightGBM). 
4. Feature Selection: Identify key predictors using techniques like Recursive Feature 
Elimination (RFE). 
5. Evaluation: Use RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores to evaluate model performance.
